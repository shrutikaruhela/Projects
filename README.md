# Projects
Description of the labs and projects I have done- I can't publish these publicly because it goes against the academic integrity policy for classes and non-disclosure agreements for past internships, but following is a short description of some of the projects I have worked on and experience I have.

Email me at shrutika.ruhela@gmail.com for more information.

Shell: Wrote a mini shell in C that can run processes in the foreground and background, catch and handle signals, and understand basic commands.

Malloc: Wrote a dynamic memory allocator in C that maximized throughput and utilization, using explicit and segregated lists to manage blocks of free memory. This involved a strong understanding of virtual memory.

Proxy: Implemented a web proxy in C that handled client side requests, transformed them into a HTTP request, forwarded it to the server, got the response, and forwarded the response back to the client. The proxy could handle several connections concurrently by using a multithreaded design.

Pixel/Images: Using arrays to manipulate pixels and images (transformations, rotations, etc.)

Virtual Machine: Created a simple virtual machine for class that parsed bytecode, interpreted it, and excecuted the instructions. This involved a strong understanding of how the program counter goes through the program, how the call stack works, and how the heap stores dynamic memory.

Text Buffer: Implemented a text buffer using a doubly-linked list.

Trees: Use a tree-like data structure to execute string manipulation.

Bomb: Using the GDB debugger (a lot) to step through x86-64 assembly code and find the password so that the 'bomb' doesn't explode.

Attack: Perform several types of attacks using exploit strings.
